# hashcatch
Capture handshakes of nearby WiFi networks automatically

Hashcatch can be used in any linux device including a Raspberry Pi and Nethunter devices so that you can capture handshakes while walking your dog 

#### Setting up
1. Run ./setup.sh
2. Enter the interface that can be switched to monitor mode
3. The script will install the prerequisites

#### Usage
```sudo ./hashcatch.sh```
* The script runs indefinitely until keyboard interrupt
* Handshakes captured will be stored in handshakes/ directory
* The captured WiFi network's BSSID and ESSID will be stored in db file
* [Experimental] If you are connected to the internet while capturing, the following data will also be added to the db file
  * latitude
  * longitude
  * signal radius
  * time of record
  * Note: Kudos to Alexander Mylnikov (mylnikov.org) for the API he's running that returns the location details of a router's MAC address using public databases

#### The "config" file
* The config file will be generated by the setup.sh script
* You can later edit the "interface" field to set the interface of your choice
* You can also add an "ignore" field to mention the WiFi networks you want hashcatch to ignore while running
* Refer the example given below to know about the format in which entries should be added to config file

#### Format of config file
```option name=option1,option2,option3```

No space in between option name, equal sign and options

Example
```
interface=wlan0
ignore=Google Starbucks,AndroidAP
```

PS: Even though I was working on this script few days before (https://twitter.com/evilsocket "@evilsocket") posted about his (https://twitter.com/pwnagotchi "pwnagotchi"), his work has definitely been an inspiration for this project!
